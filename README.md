# DATAMIX: A Dynamic Adaptive Task Assignment Algorithm Based on Mixed Heuristics

## Introduction

Efficient task scheduling is critical in distributed and heterogeneous computing environments such as cloud systems and data centers. Traditional heuristics like Minimum Completion Time (MCT) and Minimum Execution Time (MET) often struggle to generalize well across diverse workloads. To address this, we propose **DATAMIX**, a lightweight and adaptive task scheduling algorithm that dynamically blends both MCT and MET using a threshold-based decision mechanism.

---

## Problem Statement

Given a matrix of execution times where each row represents a task and each column represents a machine, the objective is to assign each task to exactly one machine in such a way that the **maximum completion time** (makespan) across all machines is minimized.

---

## Proposed Algorithm: DATAMIX

DATAMIX works in four main stages:

- **Input**: The algorithm reads a task-machine execution time matrix.
- **Initialization**: A vector is initialized to keep track of each machineâ€™s total completion time.
- **Task Assignment**:
  - For each task:
    - Identify `mn1`: machine with the least load + task time (MCT).
    - Identify `mn2`: machine with the minimum execution time (MET).
    - Compute a dynamic threshold from task execution time distribution.
    - Compare assignment difference between `mn1` and `mn2`.
    - Assign the task to `mn2` if the difference is within the threshold; else to `mn1`.
- **Output**: The final makespan is the maximum value from the load vector.

## Experimental Results

We tested DATAMIX on 12 standard benchmark datasets from the task scheduling domain and compared it against:

- OLB (Opportunistic Load Balancing)
- MCT (Minimum Completion Time)
- MET (Minimum Execution Time)
- SA (Simulated Annealing)
- kPB (k Percent Best)

Below is the comparison of makespan values (lower is better):

| Instance      | OLB           | MCT           | MET           | SA            | kPB           | **DATAMIX**     |
